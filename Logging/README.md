# Logging

This is a tiny library to create fancy and nice looking logging function calls,
and produce messages like this:
````
[INFO]: This is an info message.
[WARNING]: This is a warning message.
[ERROR]: This is an error message!
````
with code like this:
````
Logging::info(...)
Logging::warning(...)
Logging::error(...)
````
